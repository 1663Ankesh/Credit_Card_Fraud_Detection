# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

**creditcard.csv** is the dataset upon which various algorithms have been applied

_Most Efficient Algorithm found was XGBoost_

# A simple web application have been made using node JS where a user can enter values of v1, v2, ..., v28, amount and the prediction will be shown that whether that is a fraudulent transaction or not

# Ports:

server.py runs on _port:5000_
index.js runs on _port:3000_

_PLEASE NOTE_ : The Web Page can be accessed by [http://localhost:3000].

_PLEASE NOTE_ : creditcard.csv,KNN_upsampling_model.joblib is not in this repo because of file size limit
